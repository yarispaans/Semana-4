			<H1>EDC LAS VEGAS REVEALS FULL STAGE LINE-UPS<br> FOR 2018 FESTIVAL</H1>
			<P>EDC Las Vegas has revealed the 2018 line-ups for its eight stages. Aside from Kinetic Playground<br> and Circuit Gardens, each stage has an official host, including the return of HARD. EDC takes over<br> the Las Vegas Motor Speedway 18th through 20th May.<br/>
        	The line-up was originally announced 14th February by EDC founder Pasquale Rotella via<br> Insomniac’s Night Owl Radio. While fans still don’t know when these artists will be playing, the<br> where has been confirmed.<br>On to London, and aside from the massive Printworks re-opening (don't miss Red Axes), Matthew<br> Herbert, FunkinEven, Chris Farrell, Parris and Kowton at Bussey is what fans of intelligently formed<br> alt-dance need. Meanwhile, dnb heads should hit Exit Records at Electric Brixton— the label's<br> finest lining up for a large one.</P>

	     	<H1 >THESE ARE THE TOP 30 UK CLUB EVENTS<br> IN MARCH 2018</H1>
	    	<P>The year is gathering momentum like a runaway techno cut, so it's already time for the top 30 UK<br> club events in March 2018.<br>
			Amazingly festival season is now upon us— or at least it is in the North of England. Our top pick for<br> the region is the irrepressible BangFace Weekender at Pontins in Southport, where silly mess<br> marries serious noise in a colourful rave ritual.<br>
			Merseyside hosts the fourth instalment of Liverpool Disco Festival, edit-king Jamie 3:26, Windy City<br> hero Rahaan, oft-unsung UK titan Red Greg and ultimate diva Jocelyn Brown are amongst those<br> locked-in. Sheffield way, Hope Works welcomes two of Bristol's most sonically-forward crews, Livity<br> Sound and Timedance. And Manchester completes the top five via powerful techno at Meat Free's<br> 5th Birthday, and Cult marking three years with pure contemporary quality. </P>
